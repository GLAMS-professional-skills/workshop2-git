# Git Workshop

## Create a repository from GitHub and editing it online

GitHub has an introductory [exercise](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world), try it out

## Create a repository locally first

Since Git is a distributed VCS, you can create a repository locally, and work there before ever deciding to publish on GitHub.
Follow the instructions [here](local-repo.md) to try that out.
